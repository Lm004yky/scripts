Astana-Kitap Publishing

These are VPython (Glowscript) code snippets integrated 
in the Physics textbooks of Astana-Kitap Publishing Company. 

Some of them are taken from web-resources, some of them are written by authors of textbooks. 

Code snippets are used together with questions in order to make connection 
between physical processes and formulas that describe these processes. 

For example: 
'''
Open in browser 'github.com/astana-kitap/scripts'. Open 'LithiumAtom.py'. 
Copy-paste code and run it in ‘trinket.io/glowscript’ in 'Fullscreen' mode. 
What is the meaning of the red, grey and cyan spheres? 
What does happen when you write 'y1=10*(sin(8*pi*i/1000))'? Why?
'''

The goal is to deepen the knowledge of physics and to understand the basic tenets of programming. 

If you want to contribute to this project please contact 
shokonurs@gmail.com or owt.ytnewt.thgie@gmail.com. 

We need glowscript short and simple code snippets (no more than 20 lines) 
that show physical (chemical, biological ) processes.
